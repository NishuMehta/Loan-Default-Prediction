## Model Training

Three models were trained:

| Model               | ROC-AUC Score |
|--------------------|---------------|
| Logistic Regression| **0.7531** (Best) |
| Random Forest       | 0.7390        |
| XGBoost             | 0.7409        |

The final deployed model is **Logistic Regression** due to its balance of accuracy, interpretability, and low overfitting.
